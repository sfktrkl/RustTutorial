    // Integer types

    // Tuple type
    // A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with
    // a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length:
    // once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
    let _tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // The variable tup binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered
    // a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple,
    // we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value.
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (_x, y, _z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);

    // We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.)
    // followed by the index of the value we want to access.
    let _x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let _five_hundred = _x.0;
    let _six_point_four = _x.1;
    let _one = _x.2;

    // The Array Type
    // Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array.
    // Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
    // Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
    let _a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // You write an arrayâ€™s type using square brackets with the type of
    // each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array.
    let _a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for
    // each element by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon,
    // and then the length of the array in square brackets.
    let _a = [3; 5];
    let _a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];

    // An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can
    // be allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing.
    let _first = _a[0];
    let _second = _a[1];
