// We define a module by starting with the mod keyword and then specify
// the name of the module (in this case, front_of_house) and place curly
// brackets around the body of the module. Inside modules, we can have other
// modules, as in this case with the modules hosting and serving.

// By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name
// why theyâ€™re related. Programmers using this code would have an easier
// time finding the definitions they wanted to use because they could navigate
// the code based on the groups rather than having to read through
// all the definitions. Programmers adding new functionality to this
// code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.
